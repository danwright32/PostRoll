"""PostRoll brand design tokens.

The one home for the colours, type and mat scale the media generators share.
Before this module each generator carried its own copies, so a brand change had
to be found and applied by hand in every file and a missed one shipped an
off-brand asset (#162).

`PostRollApp/Sources/DesignTokens.swift` mirrors the shared colours for the
app's own chrome, because Swift cannot import this file. `tests/
test_design_tokens.py` asserts the two agree, since nothing else keeps that
seam honest.

Deliberately NOT here: per-template geometry. Logo width, title baselines and
the row rhythm differ by template on purpose (the scroll reel's colophon logo
is 800px because it sits under a full-width strip; the collage plate's is 240px
because it sits in a 90px caption plate). Those stay in the generator that owns
them. What belongs here is anything two templates are supposed to agree on.

# ── Colour ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

#: Which generation of the collage design a rendered PNG came from (#160).
#:
#: Bumped whenever the collage's tokens or geometry change enough that an
#: already-rendered PNG no longer looks like a fresh one. Cached collages carry
#: this in their layout sidecar, so the app can badge a day whose collage
#: predates the current design instead of it silently rendering the old look
#: forever. `DesignTokens.collageDesignVersion` mirrors it; nothing but the
#: parity test keeps the two in step.
#:
#: 1 is the gallery redesign (c65a0d6: gallery mat, caption plate, shape-aware
#: layout). Anything rendered before that is unstamped, which reads as older
#: rather than as version 0.

#: The gallery mat and every cream surface. The one background colour.
CREAM = (252, 250, 247)

#: The hairline around a matted print in the before/after and morph templates.
CREAM_EDGE = (212, 201, 192)

#: The hairline around a collage cell and a scroll-reel print.
#:
#: Two units warmer and lighter than CREAM_EDGE above, which is drift rather
#: than intent: the two pairs of templates were written at different times and
#: each picked its own value for the same idea. Both are preserved here so the
#: consolidation does not change a single rendered pixel; unifying them is a
#: brand decision for Dan, not a refactor. See #162.
HAIRLINE = (214, 208, 200)

#: Primary text on cream. Warm near-black, never true black.
TEXT_DARK = (60, 55, 50)

#: Quiet secondary text, such as a placard subtitle.
WARM_MID = (122, 104, 96)

#: The one accent, on cream: rules, dividers, the live state word.
ROSE_GOLD = (160, 105, 95)

#: The accent on a blurred photograph, where the on-cream value goes muddy.
#: Used by the story template only.
ROSE_GOLD_LIGHT = (196, 135, 122)

#: The split divider drawn over photography, where cream would disappear.
